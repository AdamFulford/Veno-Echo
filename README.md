Veno-Echo is a powerful stereo digital delay device for Eurorack synthesizers. This is the first module from Venus Instruments.

ABOUT

• Two separate channels with independent controls for delay time, feedback, and reverse direction. Combine with width and cross feedback, for total control over the stereo soundscape

• Warm wet line high-pass and low-pass filters, with configurable cut-off frequencies and resonance, tailor the character of your repeats

• Artefact-free transitions for all parameter changes. Mash the time controls for stuttering glitch and shuffle effects, or send wild CV modulation to multiple parameters, all without clicks or pops

• Modulation CV input to sculpt your own pitch wobble

• Tap in the tempo or use the clock input, and select a multiplier or divider for each channel, to generate rhythmic patterns which stay in sync with the rest of your system

FEATURES

• Stereo inputs and outputs

• High performance op-amps in the audio path

• Independent delay time, feedback, and reverse controls for each channel

• Tap tempo and externally clockable

• Stereo width and cross feedback controls

• Extensive CV controls, including external modulation input

• Low pass and high pass filters on wet line with adjustable cutoff frequencies and resonance

• Performance oriented filter crossfade control

• Configurable filters to pre or post feedback loop

• Internal modulation with adjustable rate and depth

• Feedback up to 125% to allow for run-away repeats

• Right input normals to the left input for mono to stereo operation

• Gate inputs for reverse switching

• Built around the Electrosmith Daisy embedded platform

How to flash Firmware:

If you are using Windows you may need to reset the Seed's USB driver before proceeding. Check out the instructions using Zadig here: https://github.com/electro-smith/DaisyWiki/wiki/Using-Zadig-to-Reset-USB-Driver-(Windows-Only)

1) Download the latest firmware .bin file from Veno-Echo/Firmware
2) Connect the Veno-Echo to your computer via the micro-USB port on the back
4) Press both buttons on the back of the module (either side of the micro-USB port)
5) Go to https://electro-smith.github.io/Programmer/ using Chrome
6) Click Connect, select 'DFU in FS Mode - Paired' and Connect
7) Under 'Or select a file from your computer' hit Browse, and point it at the downloaded .bin file
8) Hit Program and wait until it completes.
