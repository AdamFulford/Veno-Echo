Veno-Echo is a powerful stereo digital delay device for Eurorack synthesizers.

ABOUT

• Two separate channels with independent controls for delay time, feedback, and reverse direction. Combine with width and cross feedback, for total control over the stereo soundscape
• Warm wet line high-pass and low-pass filters, with configurable cut-off frequencies and resonance, tailor the character of your repeats
• Artefact-free transitions for all parameter changes. Mash the time controls for stuttering glitch and shuffle effects, or send wild CV modulation to multiple parameters, all without clicks or pops
• Modulation CV input to sculpt your own pitch wobble
• Tap in the tempo or use the clock input, and select a multiplier or divider for each channel, to generate rhythmic patterns which stay in sync with the rest of your system

FEATURES

• Stereo inputs and outputs
• High performance op-amps in the audio path
• Independent delay time, feedback, and reverse controls for each channel
• Tap tempo and externally clockable
• Stereo width and cross feedback controls
• Extensive CV controls, including external modulation input
• Low pass and high pass filters on wet line with adjustable cutoff frequencies and resonance
• Performance oriented filter crossfade control
• Configurable filters to pre or post feedback loop
• Internal modulation with adjustable rate and depth
• Feedback up to 125% to allow for run-away repeats
• Right input normals to the left input for mono to stereo operation
• Gate inputs for reverse switching
• Built around the Electrosmith Daisy embedded platform
